            <p class="verse">Can't stop addicted to the shindig<br>
                Chop top he says I'm gonna win big<br>
                Choose not a life of imitation<br>
                Distant cousin to the reservation<br>
                Defunct the pistol that you pay for<br>
                This punk the feeling that you stay for<br>
                In time I want to be your best friend<br>
                East Side lovers living on the West End<br>
                 Knock out but boy you better come to<br>
                Don't die you know the truth as some do<br>
                Go write your message on the pavement<br>
                Burning so bright I wonder what the wave meant<br>
                White heat is screaming in the jungle<br>
                Complete the motion if you stumble<br>
                Go ask the dust for any answers<br>
                Come back strong with 50 belly dancers
                The world I love<br>
                The tears I drop<br>
                To be part of<br>
                The wave can't stop<br>
                Ever wonder if it's all for you<br>
                The world I love<br>
                The trains I hop<br>
                To be part of<br>
                The wave can't stop<br>
                Come and tell me when it's time to

            <p class="chorus">The world I love<br>
                The tears I drop<br>
                To be part of<br>
                The wave can't stop<br>
                Ever wonder if it's all for you<br>
                The world I love<br>
                The trains I hop<br>
                To be part of<br>

            <p class="verse">Sweetheart is bleeding in the snowcone<br>
                So smart she's leading me to ozone<br>
                Music the great communicator<br>
                Use two sticks to make it in the nature<br>
                I'll get you into penetration<br>
                The gender of a generation<br>
                The birth of every other nation<br>
                Worth your weight the gold of meditation<br>
                This chapter's going to be a close one<br>
                Smoke rings I know you're going to blow one<br>
                All on a spaceship persevering<br>
                Use my hands for everything but steering<br>
                Can't stop the spirits when they need you<br>
                Mop tops are happy when they feed you<br>
                J. butterfly is in the treetop<br>
                Birds that blow the meaning into bebop
